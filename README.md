# Telecom-Churn-Project

In this data exploration, I will be looking at churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

My job as a data analyst is to deep dive into the relevant customer data to predict behavior and develop focused customer retention programs.

## Process
I downloaded the data set, performed all of the analysis using SQL in BigQuery, then visualized my findings in Tableau.

Next, I dived into the data to answer the question, why are customer's leaving the telecommunications company? Here are some further questions that will help my analysis.

**Questions**
1. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?
2. What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
3. What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep their service?
4. Are there any patterns/preferences in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
5. Which features and services are most profitable?
6. What can the company do to retain their customers?


## Analysis 

First, I checked for the total number of customers. There are 7043.

Then, I looked into how many customers churned. There are 1869.

Next, I looked into how much it cost the company to lose these customers. They lost 17% of their revenue to those churned customers.

**1. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?**

   To look into this, I first grouped customers by their tenure.

Most of the churn customers (49%) Left the company before 6 months. That means that they could be focusing on retention programs marketed towards new customers, so they could be incentivized to keep their accounts.
