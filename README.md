# Telecom-Churn-Project

In this data exploration, I will be looking at Churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

I'll be analyzing all relevant customer data to predict behavior to retain customers.

**Questions**
1. How many customers joined the company during the last quarter?
2. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?
3. What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
4. Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?
5. What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services?
6.  Is there any patterns/preference in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
7. Which features and services are most profitable?
