# Telecom-Churn-Project

In this data exploration, I will be looking at churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status.

My job as a data analyst is to deep dive into the relevant customer data to predict behavior and develop focused customer retention programs.

## Process
**Questions**
1. How many customers joined the company during the last quarter?
2. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?
3. What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
6. What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep their service?
7. Are there any patterns/preferences in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
8. Which features and services are most profitable?
9. What can the company do to retain their customers?
